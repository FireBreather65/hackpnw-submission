# hackpnw-submission

We built this website to bring to light the dangers of water pollution, specifically in the Duwamish River. <a href="https://firebreather65.github.io/hackpnw-submissions/">You can view the live site here.</a>

This is a fully responsive website that includes specially styled links, a thoughtfully chosen color scheme, and relevant typography. The website was coded using only HTML and CSS.

The below video/gif demonstrates some of our project's features!
